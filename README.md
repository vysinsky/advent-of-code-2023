# Advent of Code 2023

My rules for taking part in the event:

* Every day in a different language
* Language suggested by ChatGPT (with the only condition to develop and run on a Windows machine)
* AI is used ONLY for finding a language, not for code generation
* AI can be used for getting code examples (to learn the syntax of a new language) but it is not allowed to use it to explain or help with the solution code itself
* No checking of Reddit before resolving the task

Every task input and description is versioned within the day folder for documentation reasons.

| Day                   | Language chosen by ChatGPT | Experience before the task |

| Day 1: Trebuchet?!    | Python                     | Beginner                   |
| Day 2: Cube Conundrum | PowerShell                 | None                       |
| Day 3: Gear Ratios    | JavaScript                 | Expert                     |
| Day 4:                | Ruby                       | None                       |
