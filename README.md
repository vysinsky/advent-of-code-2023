# Advent of Code 2023

My rules for taking part in event:

* Every day in different language
* Language suggested by ChatGPT (with only condition to develop and run on Windows machine)
* AI is used ONLY for finding a language, not for code generation
* No checking of reddit before resolving the task

Every task input and task description is versioned withing the day folder for documentation reasons.
